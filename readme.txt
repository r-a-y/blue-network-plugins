Miss how network plugins were separated from regular plugins like in Wordpress MU? Miss the ol' blue network plugins color as well? Check this out!

== Description ==

Wordpress 3.0 is cool like Thelonius Monk, but for super administrators coming from Wordpress MU, if you head on over to the plugins page, you'll notice something missing.

Network (or sitewide) plugins are now merged into the entire plugins list!

If you're like me and missed how your network plugins were listed at the very top with the uber-cool blue color, then you'll love this plugin!

Need a visual?  Check out [this screenshot](http://i46.tinypic.com/6gv32g.png).

If you're **not** using [network mode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) in Wordpress 3.0, you *don't* need this plugin.


== Installation ==

#### This plugin requires Wordpress 3.0 in network mode ####

1. Download, install and activate the plugin.

I'd recommend putting `blue-network-plugins.php` in /wp-content/mu-plugins/ so all your sites can take advantage of this plugin without manually activating.


== Screenshots ==

A screenshot can be found [here](http://i46.tinypic.com/6gv32g.png).


== Recommendations ==

Check out the companion plugin, [Green Active Plugins!](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/green-active-plugins/).

They go well together like coffee and doughnuts!
